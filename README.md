A home web server host using Rust. Creates a host site at the IP adress and port specified in the config.json. Currently supports one minecraft server. 

Plans:
In the future there will be a drop down menu that let's the user choose from several server options. The server should shutdown after an hour of inactivity on the website or any of the hosted servers.
