# Rust Game Hosting Server

This project is a home web server host written in Rust. It creates a host site at the IP address and port specified.

## Status: Limbo

**Warning:** This project is currently in limbo and may not work on newer versions of Rust. It is not actively maintained, and compatibility issues are likely. Use at your own risk.

## Features
- Unique servers can be represented with the `HostableServerInterface`.
- The update functionality needs further work.
- The server exposes a `GeneralBashServer`, which is controlled by two executables in the path: `start.sh` and `stop.sh`.

## Usage
Refer to the source code and scripts for details on how to start and stop supported game servers (e.g., Minecraft, Arma).

**Note:** Contributions and updates are welcome, but the project is not guaranteed to work out-of-the-box.
